title: Reflection
---

Refraction is the change in direction of wave propagation due to a change in its transmission medium. During refraction, the phase velocity of the wave is changed but its frequency remains constant.


Material: $n_1 < n_2$

 --------------- --------------
 **Reflexion:**  $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$
 **Fraction:**   $\frac{\sin(\alpha)}{\sin(\beta)}=\frac{n_2}{n_1}=\frac{c_1}{c_2}=\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}$

### Total Internal Reflection
The total refelction will happen at the critical angle

$$\alpha_C = \arcsin\left( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \right)$$
where $\alpha_C$ is the critical angle, $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive index.


{% explanation %}

- If $\alpha \le \alpha_C$, the ray will split; some of the ray will reflect
- If $\alpha \gt \alpha_C$, the entire ray reflects from the boundary.

### Polarization Angle
Light that is reflected at Brewster's angle

$$\alpha_G = \arctan\left( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \right)$$
