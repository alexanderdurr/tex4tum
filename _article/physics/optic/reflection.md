title: Reflection and Refraction
---
Reflection and Refraction are two wave phenomena that cause a change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two different media.
In general, a light wave is partially refracted and partially reflected when it passes from one medium to another at any angle other than 0Â° from the normal.


<!--* **Reflection** causes the wavefront to return into the medium from which it originated. The angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected. -->

**Reflection**: The angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected. 
	
$$\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$$
with the angle of incidence $\alpha_1$ and the angle of reflection $\alpha_2$.

<!--* **Refraction** changes the direction of the wave propagating into another medium. During refraction, the phase velocity of the wave is changed but its frequency remains constant.-->
**Refraction**: The phase velocity of the wave is changed but its frequency remains constant.

$$\frac{\sin(\alpha)}{\sin(\beta)}=\frac{n_2}{n_1}=\frac{c_1}{c_2}=\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}$$
with the angle of incidence $\alpha$, the angle of refraction $\beta$, the refractive indices $n_1$ and $n_2$.


The refractive index $n$ of a material

$$n = \sqrt{\mu_r \epsilon_r}$$
with $\epsilon_r$ is the material's relative permittivity, and $\mu_r$ is its relative permeability.



<!--
 --------------- --------------
 **Reflexion:**  $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$
 **Fraction:**   $\frac{\sin(\alpha)}{\sin(\beta)}=\frac{n_2}{n_1}=\frac{c_1}{c_2}=\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}$

### Total Internal Reflection
The total refelction will happen at the critical angle

$$\alpha_C = \arcsin\left( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \right)$$
where $\alpha_C$ is the critical angle, $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive index.


{% explanation %}

- If $\alpha \le \alpha_C$, the ray will split; some of the ray will reflect
- If $\alpha \gt \alpha_C$, the entire ray reflects from the boundary.

### Polarization Angle
Light that is reflected at Brewster's angle

$$\alpha_G = \arctan\left( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \right)$$
