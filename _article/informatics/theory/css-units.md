CSS offers a number of different units for expressing length. Some have their history in typography, such as point (pt) and pica (pc), others are known from everyday use, such as centimeter (cm) and inch (in).



| Unit |  | |
|-----|----|----|
| Points (`pt`)  | 6pt      | 12pt |
| Pixel (`px`)   | 8px      | 16px |
| Pica (`pc`)    | 0.5pc    | 1.0pc |
| Inch (`in`)    | 1/16 in  | 1/8 in |
| Milli Meter (`mm`)    |   |  |

The Dots per Inch (DPI) refers to the `pt` per `in`. The default is DPI=96.



## Relative Lengths


| Relative Lengths  |  |
|-----|----|
| quad-width      | `em`  |
| x-height        | `ex`  |
| Viewport width  | `vw`  |
