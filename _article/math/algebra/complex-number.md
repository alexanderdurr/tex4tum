Complex numbers extend the concept of the one-dimensional number line to the two-dimensional complex plane by using the horizontal axis for the real part and the vertical axis for the imaginary part.

$$\cx z := a + b\i = r \cdot \exp(\i \varphi)$$ 
with Imaginary Unit $\i = \sqrt{-1}$.

## Rules
$\i^{2n} = -1^n$ &emsp;&emsp; $\i^{2n+1} = -\i^n$ &emsp;&emsp; $\i^{-1} = -\i$

Conjugate: $\cxc z = a - b\i$ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; $\exp(\overline{i\varphi}) = \exp({-i\varphi})$
$\cx z \ol{\cx z} = \abs{\cx z}^2 = a^2+b^2$

Inverse: $\displaystyle \cx z^{-1} = \frac{\cxc z}{\cxc z} \cx z=\frac{a - b\i}{a^2+b^2}$
