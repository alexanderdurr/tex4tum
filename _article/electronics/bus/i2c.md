I2C is serial bus used to attach lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance.


## Specification

I2C uses only two bidirectional open collector or open drain lines, *SDA* and *SCK*, which are pulled up with resistors. Typical voltages used are +5 V or +3.3 V.


Transmission Speeds
