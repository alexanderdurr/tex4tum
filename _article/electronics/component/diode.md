A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts primarily in one direction.

| Equations    | $u_D = u_T \cdot \ln \left(\frac{i_D}{I_S} + 1 \right)$ <br> $i_D = I_S \cdot \left( \exp \left(\frac{u_D}{U_T}\right) -1 \right)$ |

## Shottky Diode
A Schottky diode has a low forward voltage and allows very fast switching.

$I=I_\mathrm{S} \left( e^\frac{V_\text{D}}{n V_\text{T}} - 1 \right)$


## Zener Diode
A Zener Diode does not only conduct in the forward direction but also allows the current to flow in the reverse direction, when the so-called "Zener voltage" is reached.


## Light Emitting Diode (LED)
The wavelength of the diode depends on the energy band gap in the semiconductor.
