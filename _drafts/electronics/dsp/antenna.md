## Power Density

* Transmission Power Density

	$$F_T(r) = \frac{P_{T0}}{4 \pi r^2}$$
	with TX-power $P_{T0}$ and radius $r$

* Received Power $P_R$

	$$P_R = F_T(r) \frac{\lambda^2}{4 \pi}$$




## Antenna Gain
The antenna gain $g_a$ is the ratio between the power density in the direction of maximum radiation and the power density of a isotropic (spheric) radiator at a reference distance.

Antenna directivity: ratio between the power density in the direction of maximum radiation and the average power density at a reference distance


Effective Isotropically Radiated Power: $P_0 \cdot g_a$
