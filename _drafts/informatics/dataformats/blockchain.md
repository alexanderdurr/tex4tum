A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. As a result, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data of their blocks.

```
 Block 2        Block 1
+-------+      +------+
| hash -|----->| hash |  
| data  |      | data |
+-------+      +------+
```

## Database
Peers don't have exactly the same version of the blockchain history at all times. they keep the highest scoring version of the database that they currently know of. no peer is "trusted" more than any other.




## Decentralization



## Ledger
Ledger: recording and totaling transactions


## Transactions
transactions provide privacy through pseudonymity. Each transaction is associated with the public address of the sender and receiver, the names of the owners of these addresses are at no time made known to the bitcoin network. To increase privacy, each person could create as many public addresses as they like.


## Forks
 two groups are free to each run their own versions of the blockchain software, which creates two descendant blockchains with their own separate histories from that point forward.
 
* soft fork: forward-compatible, old consensus rules consider blocks mined by new consensus rules as valid
* hard fork: 


## Challenges
* Encryption and verification of blockchain transactions are computationally intensive 





Talk about blockchain:
* copetition leads to inefficient usage of ressources
* use the power of the crowd
