title: Demo of Interactive Features

This page is a showcase of the features that TeX4TUM provides and demonstrates how learning materials could be made interactive, fast accessible, and neat.

TODO This will be written into the todo-list

Click on the heading to unfold the definition box.


## Interactive Features

### Content Categories
Read only the content you really need. Use the options in the top right corner to change the visibility of the following content:<br>

Using Liquid Tags:

{% definition %}The square root is the math function $\sqrt{\cdot}$.{% enddefinition %}
{% example %} Example $\sqrt{ x^4 } = x^2$ {% endexample %}

Explanation: This is an explanation.




### Interactive Equations

For a low-pass filter, the Cut-Off Frequency is 

$$f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi R C}$$
with the resistance $R$ and capacity $C$

Click on the equation to expand the legend.
For resistance $R$ = <span id="R_val" onclick="askValue(this.id)">10k</span>Î© and capacity $C$ = <span id="C_val" onclick="askValue(this.id)">100n</span>F the Cut-Off Frequency is $f_c$ = <tspan id="F_val">159 Hz</tspan>.
Click on the values of R and C in the text to change them!

<!-- Even more complex equations such as $\int \sqrt{x^2} \diff x = \frac{1}{3} x^3$ are rendered beautifully with [KaTex](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/)). -->


### Interactive Diagrams
Play with diagrams for better understanding. Click and drag the black ray with the mouse or change any value in the diagram.

{% include svg-object.html id="fraction" filename="fraction.svg" %}



### Fast Fuzzy Search
Find an answer blazingly fast. The fuzzy search in the top bar displays results immediately without slow sever communication. Just hit `tab` to focus the search, then type e.g. "did" to search for "Diode".



## Basic Fomartting

### Tables
Tables are easily generated.

| Feature | Works |
|------|---|
| Tables | yes |
| MOSI | Master Out, Slave In |
| MISO | Master In, Slave Out |


### Abreviations
Furthermore, abbreviations such as USB, BIOS, SVG, or JPEG do not need explanations anymore. If you do not know it just move the mouse over it.


### Tab Boxes
You can use boxes with tabs for content that exists in similiar variations.

{% tabbox %}
#### Tab 1
This should by displayed in tab 1

#### Tab 2
tabs are simply created by the headers

#### Tab 3
and this is tab 3. Markdown *elements* and tex $\sqrt{3}$ are supported.
{% endtabbox %}

Also content after the tabbox is displayed normally.



## ToDo
* Full responsive design
* remember options with cookies
* consistent JS framework for interactive content
* Improved search: Sorting results, reaction to no results
* More content



## Feature Tests

### Content Categories

**Using Liquid Tags:**

{% definition %}The square root is the math function $\sqrt{\cdot}$.{% enddefinition %}
{% example %} Example $\sqrt{ x^4 } = x^2$ {% endexample %}
{% explanation %} $x^4 = x^{2+2} = x^2 \cdot x^2$  {% endexplanation %}
{% legend %} where $x$ is an arbitrary number {% endlegend %}



**Using Own Parser:**

Definition: The square root is the math function


Example: $\sqrt{ x^4 } = x^2$


Explanation: The answer is $x^2$ because $x^4 = x^{2+2} = x^2 \cdot x^2$


Legend: where $x$ is an arbitrary number




**Using Headings**


### Explanation of This
This is an explanation to demonstrate the auto detection of an explanation 


even over several lines


### Example Subsection
This is an example to demonstrate the auto detection of an example
even over several lines










<script type="text/javascript">
function RC_calcFrequency() {
 var C1 = getValue( document.getElementById("C_val").textContent );
 var R1 = getValue( document.getElementById("R_val").textContent );
 var F1 = document.getElementById("F_val");
 var freq = 1/(2 * Math.PI * C1 * R1);
 F1.textContent=freq.toPrecision(3)+" Hz";
 tau.textContent=(R1 * C1 * 1000).toPrecision(3)+" ms";
}

function syncValues(id, value){
    RC_calcFrequency();
}
</script>
